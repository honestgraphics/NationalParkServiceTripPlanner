#JSON & The VARgonauts *presents* NPS Connect

## What the project does
This is the implementation of Project 1, done as homework for the February 2018 UNC Coding Boot Camp. This project explores national parks in the United States. We look at the parks by state, by name, or by choosing a random park. All of the data on each park is collected using the API from The National Parks Service. Google Maps API is used to help display a map of the park and nearby gas and supplies. Packery is used to help our menu be draggable and sortable. We have a sign up sheet for membership and a login using Firebase. 

## How to get started with the app
You can select a state by drop down menu. That method returns a list of parks in that state. You then have to click on the park that interest you. You could also also select a park by a drop down menu. Another choice would be to click on the random park. All three options eventually lead you to a specific park. After you have chosen your park, you can click on the buttons on the right to explore more resources.
